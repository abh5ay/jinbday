        <h1>Happy Birthday Jiniya Arora ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
        <p>
            Nvr thought I'm gonna say this, I'm incapable of love but then u showed up‚Ä¶ out of nowhere. <br>
            When I lost all my hopes to find that one eternal love, u showed up, so happy, that smile, that innocence‚Ä¶ <br>
            Can't forget ever‚Ä¶ destiny would have ended us there, but it always keeps getting u back to me. <br>
            Like it's God's decision for me‚Ä¶ u r the most wonderful personality I have ever seen‚Ä¶ the smile u carry‚Ä¶ the ambition u have‚Ä¶ the vibe u got into me seen by everyone including my family‚Ä¶ <br>
            I nvr thought I could be this in love with anyone. All I could imagine is u in my life forever‚Ä¶ 
        </p>
        <p>
            This love or destiny, whatever u r‚Ä¶ u r just mine‚Ä¶ all those happiness‚Ä¶ it's u‚Ä¶ <br>
            I always wondered why I love u when u r not into love w me‚Ä¶ but my heart always says, "Abhay, if it's not her, then I don't want anyone‚Ä¶" <br>
            I just want u to have everything in life‚Ä¶ I wish u a happy birthday with lots of happiness, laughs, and smiles‚Ä¶ <br>
            Can't get over the fact that I'm ur boyfriend lmao, the biggest flex I presume‚Ä¶ <br>
            Uff, a lot to write but text can't tell u what u r to me‚Ä¶ or what ur love means to me‚Ä¶
        </p>
